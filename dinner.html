      <h2>Pork & Sausage Jambalaya</h2>
        <p>Jambalaya means a great deal to me because it’s a dish I’ve eaten ever since I could chew. There are as many versions as households in Louisiana. Some jambalayas take an entire day and ten friends, others you can produce in your own kitchen in time for dinner. Good sausage and good bacon make all the difference here.

        1/2 pound bacon, diced
        1 onion, diced
        1/2 bell pepper, diced
        1 stalk celery, diced
        1 pound smoked pork sausage, sliced
        3 cups uncooked converted Louisiana white rice
        1 teaspoon smoked paprika
        1 teaspoon dried thyme
        1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
        5 cups chicken broth
        1 cup tomato sauce or canned chopped tomatoes
        2 cups diced cooked pork
        3 green onions, chopped
        Salt
        Tabasco

        In a large heavy-bottomed pot, cook the bacon over medium-high heat until the fat is rendered, about 3 minutes. Add the onions and cook, stirring often, until browned. Add the bell pepper, celery, and sausage. Cook, stirring, for another 3 minutes, then add the rice, paprika, thyme, and red pepper flakes.
        Increase the heat to high and add the chicken broth and tomato sauce, then the pork and green onions. Stir well and bring to a boil. Cover, reduce the heat to low, and simmer for 18 minutes. Remember, the pork and sausage are already cooked, you’re only making the rice at this point. Remove the pot from the heat and it’s ready to serve! Season with salt and Tabasco.</p>
