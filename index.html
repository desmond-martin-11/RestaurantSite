          <p>Dr. Chef was born and raised Louisiana. He loved to hunt and also fish. In 1986, Doc graduated from Slidell High School (Slidell, LA), and enlisted in the United States Marine Corps as a reservist. He also attended Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge and was a member of Alpha Tau Omega fraternity. He studied at the Culinary Institute of America, graduating in 1992. Called to active duty for 10 months in 1990 to serve in the Middle East, he was a non-commissioned officer during Operation Desert Storm, and participated in the capture of Kuwait International Airport. He studied in Germany with Karl Josef Fuchs at the Michelin-starred Romantik Hotel Spielweg. Doc has also studied in the south of France with Alain Assaud.</p>
          <h2>Career</h2>
          <p>Doc was named one of the Ten Best New Chefs in America by Food & Wine in 1999. In 2006, he won the James Beard Foundation Award for Best Chef in the Southeast and was awarded Food Arts’ Silver Spoon Award in 2009 for revitalizing the culinary legacy of New Orleans. A former U.S. Marine, Doc partnered with Baton Rouge-based emergency reconstruction specialists Arkel International, producing ready-to-eat meals for distribution to emergency response teams and sustained strategic operations in the U.S. and around the world; the initiative promotes the Gulf Coast’s food culture.
